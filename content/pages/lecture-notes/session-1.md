Syllabus - heavy reading

Your magic wand

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

Your wand = smart phone

Your spells = apps (not games), maps, Uber, ordering food, buying stuff (Amazon, ebay, etc.), instant delivery, weather prediction

*   Split in the way we looked at the world

Age of Reason - split

*   Split disciplines
*   AND made those that did not work with "logic" & "reason" no longer legitimate

UR - Myth
---------

What it is (and why we're doing Arthur so heavily - Arthur is the UR-myth of the English speaking world)

Also - Arthur is BOTH myth & legend (true of many UR-myths)

* * *

The King is not always/necessarily the hero of a fantasy story, though the matter of kingship often is

*   Give some examples, please?

We cannot write Kingship in English or in an English context w/o unconsciously invoking Arhtur

Kingship is _Identity_

The _true_ King must be _indentified_ and must _take on_ that identity willingly

(The metaphor made concrete, after all)

Archetypes in Arthur (NOT Mists!!!)

It is ALWAYS valid to retell a myth or to use/steal/extract a part of it (or a character)

It is exciting and path-breaking to reimagine any piece of a myth

What does Arthur have to do with:

*   _The Lord of the Rings?_
*   _Game of Thrones_

How many TROPES here?

*   (What is a trope?)

* * *

Learning/apprenticeship

*   for the King
*   for the narrator/viewpoint

Go over some basics of Arthur

Does destiny=identity???

What you do _changes_ you

Do an wanna, not gonna!

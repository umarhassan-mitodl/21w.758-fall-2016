Campbell & The Hero's Journey
-----------------------------

What is the Hero's Journey (and why do we care?)

We've talked about the myth & gods

Now - Hero & Gods

Fantasy & The Hero

Is the Hero in Fantasy different thean in other genres?

(My feeling is yes - archetypal; and while may be very human/identifiable AS WELL, must also have certain specific traits)

★ ALL heros must grow over the course of the story - ALWAYS a given!

But what else?

*   Good
*   _Learn_ good/good _action_

Does every fantasy _need_ a hero?

Is every fantasy a myth?

Does every fantasy strive for the mythic?

Is Rose Walker a hero? (Is Nada?)

Hector & Lyta (Hector trying to be a new Sandman)

Doll's House
------------

Rose Walker

*   Looks for her brother, Jed
*   Goes to GA with "Gilbert" (Fiddler's Green)
*   Motel where serial murders (Corinthian)

Hector Hall & Lyta - Hector plays Sandman - he is dead

Morpheus finds Glob & Brute via ⤴

Resonances/satisfaction in Doll's House

*   It works - WHY?

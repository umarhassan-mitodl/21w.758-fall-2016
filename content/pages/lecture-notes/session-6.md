Mists of Avalon
---------------

Why this book is so central to our study/writing

1.  Cannot escape Arthur
2.  Retelling with new angle totally central to fantasy
3.  _One central_ reimagining

âžž Understand that in the late 70s the idea of Arthur as Christian in pagan Britain & uniting the two was a new, exciting idea - but it was around - it was _not_ Bradley's ONE true innovation (though she uses it quite brilliantly, especially making the Merlin a title & not an individual & The Lady of the Lake again, a title)

What is her innovation? (to tell form the pagan women's side)

*   Morgaine _not_ the villain!

_Reference:_

Gardner, John. _Grendel_. Vintage Books, 1989. ISBN: 9780679723110.

How is a villain _not_ the villain?

She takes this one change, plus the very popular idea of the time (Christian vs. pagan) and then follows logically but in doing so explains a LOT of what we might call the "silly" or "perplexing" features of the Arthurian mythos

Exercises - Morphing

1.  Group morph (several times, _only one change_, follow logically, make sense of things that don't make sense)
    *   Fairy tales for grownups
    *   Change in

Character

Who's the bad guy? (or humanize the bad guy)

2.  Ballad morph
    *   (Group 1 - no magic in the ballad)

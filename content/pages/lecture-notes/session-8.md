Warping the World 
------------------

World building (_Kushiel's Dart_)

Earth or Alt. Earth

Morphy Earth - Kushiel's 

Good reasons for using our world

The world shapes the story/the possibilities of the story

Why Medieval?

Use other periods

*   Other histories
*   Other religions
*   Carey - how does she do this?? (Brilliantly!)

You can make almost _any_ time period and _any_ place/culture work for fantasy

*   _But_ you must know it fairly well (by which I mean _very_ well)

_Kushiel's Dart_ and France/Southern France

World Building vs. generic "Fantasyland"
----------------------------------------

Where do we start? 

What interest/intrigues us?

Area of the world/culture you know & love?

What DRAWS you in fantasy???

Logical connections

Physical world

*   What people eat
*   What they wear
*   Where they live
*   How they travel
*   How they fight

➞ Cliché of medieval world

*   What era is Carey using to work from? (Early Renaissance)

How is it different from cliché medieval world?

*   Look up - Stew, Cloaks, Gold

* * *

MISTAKE - Medieval world (SCA version) with magic!

Grimdark - medieval world

*   Nasty as it really _was_

Culture & aesthetic but play fast & loose with the history (Carey)

_The Lord of the Rings_ - NOT vague medieval land

*   Pre-industrial/agrarian

Martin - Grimdark

Why is Arthur medieval - it's actually pre-medieval! (in actual time)

Research/lack of research

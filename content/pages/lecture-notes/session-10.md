Magic
-----

Magic is _moral_

Magic takes power

Rules of magic

*   Must work with the rules of the _world_
*   Built in with the world building

What does this word _need_???

(Use books we've read)

_Exercise_ - Choose 1 song

Discuss Novik

*   Magical creatures

1 change

changes _history_

changes the entire military structure

Why does it WORK?? (so VERY well??)

Magic - suspend disbelief, yes, but - be clear on the limits of what the magic can do

*   Find creative ways to _exploit_ ALL the capabilities given those limits _and costs_!
